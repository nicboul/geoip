This patch makes possible to match a packet
by its source or destination country.

GeoIP options:
        [!]   --src-cc, --source-country country[,country,country,...]

                        Match packet coming from (one of)
                        the specified country(ies)


        [!]   --dst-cc, --destination-country country[,country,country,...]
                                              
                        Match packet going to (one of)
                        the specified country(ies)

           NOTE: The country is inputed by its ISO3166 code.

The only extra files you need is a binary db (geoipdb.bin) & its index file (geoipdb.idx).
